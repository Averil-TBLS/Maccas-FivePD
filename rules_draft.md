# From [Lincs FivePD | Server Rules](https://lincsfivepd.com/rules)

***~*** is a Player vs AI where all players start out as police. Civilian Roleplays are **not** authorised as a general rule unless authorised by the CIV lead or a member of the Senior Leadership Team. At no point should you please as a civilian without prior approval.

#### In-Game Rules:

- You must follow the instructions of your supervisor or an in-game staff member at **all** times. Whether you agree with them or not.
  - If you do not agree with what they have asked of you or wish to make a complaint you can do so by opening a support ticket within the Discord Server. All reports will be taken seriously. Please provide as much information including videos if available
- Do not leave a scene half cleared up. If you had the initial call you must be the one to ensure that it is all cleared up. You should be the last to leave the scene. You must ensure that all cones, barriers, signs, bodies, vehicles etc have been cleared. 
  - You can leave a scene if somebody else releases you but they **must** agree to it and they cannot be forced to do it.
  - You must not ‘scene hop’, if you are at a job and it isn't finished, get permission before leaving. 
- No RDMing(random death match) or VDMing(vehicle death match)
- You can only be part of one specialist department at a time. 
- Do not abuse any bugs which you may find. Please report any issues to staff immediately. 
- Do not self attach to callouts. Let people play and if they require support they will request it.

#### Civilian Roleplay Rules:

- You must be part of the trusted civ group and have permission from *the civilian lead prior* to carrying out a roleplay.  If you are not part of the trusted civ you may be granted permission to carry out a roleplay to assess if you will be trusted as a civilian. 
- You must carry out role plays that you would expect to happen in the ***real world***. By this, we mean that we wouldn’t expect gun fights every two seconds or driving vehicles that are extremely fast or big that we would never be able to stop. 
- Make sure that your roleplay is not impossible to resolve. 
- If you steal a vehicle, sometimes pass the registration to enable us to put ANPR hits on it.
